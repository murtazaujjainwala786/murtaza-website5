        <p> Cricket is known to be a game played within the 22 yards of a field. But it is celebrated all around the world like a religion. Whenever a bat scores a 100 or a ball hits the wicket, itâ€™s time for celebration. Cricket defines passion, it shows how countless dreams turn into reality.</p>

    <a href="The Secret Seven or Secret Seven Society is a fictional group of child detectives created by Enid Blyton. They appear in one of several adolescent detective series which Blyton wrote.

The Secret Seven consists of Peter (the society's head), Janet (Peter's sister), Pam, Barbara, Jack, Colin and George. Jack's sister Susie and her best friend Binkie make occasional appearances in the books; they hate the Secret Seven and delight in playing tricks designed to humiliate them, although this is partly fuelled by their almost obsessive desire to belong to the society.

Unlike most other Blyton series, this one takes place during the school term time because the characters go to day schools.

Continuing Blyton's series, Pamela Butchart wrote two new adventures in the series, adding elements of horror." target="_blank">view my favourite book</a>
